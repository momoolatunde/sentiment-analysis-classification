      "Index 0: i love sci fi and am willing to put up with a lot sci fi movies tv are usually underfunded under appreciated and misunderstood i tried to like this i really did but it is to good tv sci fi as babylon is to star trek the original silly prosthetics cheap cardboard sets stilted dialogues cg that does not match the background and painfully one dimensional characters can not be overcome with a sci fi setting i sure there are those of you out there who think babylon is good sci fi tv it has it is not it has it is clichéd and uninspiring while us viewers might like emotion and character development sci fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously cf star trek it may treat important issues yet not as a serious philosophy it has it is really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish just missing a spark of life their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable often painful to watch the makers of earth know it has it is rubbish as they have to always say gene roddenberry earth otherwise people would not continue watching roddenberry ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull cheap poorly edited watching it without advert breaks really brings this home trudging trabant of a show lumbers into space spoiler so kill off a main character and then bring him back as another actor jeeez dallas all over again\n",
      "Index 1: worth the entertainment value of a rental especially if you like action movies this one features the usual car chases fights with the great van damme kick style shooting battles with the shell load shotgun and even terrorist style bombs all of this is entertaining and competently handled but there is nothing that really blows you away if you have seen your share plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit which is clever but hardly profound many of the characters are heavily stereotyped the angry veterans the terrified illegal aliens the crooked cops the indifferent feds the bitchy tough lady station head the crooked politician the fat federale who looks like he was typecast as the mexican in a hollywood movie from the all passably acted but again nothing thought the main villains were pretty well done and fairly well acted by the end of the movie you certainly knew who the good guys were and were not there was an emotional lift as the really bad ones got their just deserts very simplistic but then you were not expecting hamlet right the only thing i found really annoying was the constant cuts to vds daughter during the last fight bad not good passable\n",
      "Index 2: its a totally average film with a few semi alright action sequences that make the plot seem a little better and remind the viewer of the classic van dam films parts of the plot do not make sense and seem to be added in to use up tears in my eyes the end plot is that of a very basic type that does not leave the viewer guessing and any twists are obvious from the beginning the end scene with the flask backs do not make sense as they are added in and seem to have little relevance to the history of van dam character not really worth watching again bit disappointed in the end production even though it is apparent it was shot on a low budget certain shots and sections in the film are of poor directed quality\n"
